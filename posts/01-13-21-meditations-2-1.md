## Meditations Reflections: 2:1

### Introduction
When Coronavirus took the world by storm in 2020, society started spending 
much more time at home "social distancing" - forgoing things like communing with 
friends and family. Spending so much time isolated is obviously not an easy task on the
psyche, and the necessity of mental fortitude became ever more apparent.

Rather conveniently, I had begun reading and learning about stoicism just a couple months before
the mandated lockdowns and work-from-home efforts began in early 2020.

While it's now 2021 when I write this, I figure now is a good time to restart my reading from 
_Meditations_. The book is widely considered to be a good introduction and overview
to a stoic mindset from the mindset of then Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. We'll be skipping
the first book, as it deals more with reflecting on the specific friends and family of Marcus and 
less on ideas of the philosophy.

So, let's get to it.

### Passage

"Begin in the morning by saying to yourself, I shall meet with the busybody, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious,
unsocial. All these things happen to them because of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen that 
the nature of the good is beautiful, and that the bad is ugly, and that the nature of he who does wrong is akin to me, 
not only of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in the same intelligence and the same portion of the divinity,
I can neither be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor 
hate him. For we are made for cooperation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth.
To act against one another then is contrary to nature and it is acting against one another to become frustrated and to 
turn away."

### Reflection
The passage starts where we all who wake in the morning start - in the morning. I find that reflecting on anything in the morning
as I get up and make my coffee can help me set my day on a good path - although admittedly I do forget from time to time
as the routine of the day-to-day becomes the monotony of repetition.

Marcus wants to remind himself that on any given day, should we interact with other human beings, we will most definitely 
interact with people who are of a negative disposition. If you ever need reminding of this, just go to the grocery store.
Observe the people waiting in lines, looking bored and agitated. Observe the cashiers, some moving quickly with an air of 
anxiety, some moving slowly, with the face of apathy. Occasionally you may see someone appearing content in their position
in that place of time, and it's worth pausing on their face for a moment to reflect on how this moment does not grate against
their mood, disposition, and outlook.

A key idea in stoicism is the practice of viewing the events and circumstances "outside of yourself" - my own summarizing.
It's often good to recognize that on the grand scale of life, a single bad event is not so bad. A single bad day cannot 
hurt the story of your life, so long as you don't allow it to. Marcus hits on this point, "I can neither be injured by 
any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him". He does go a step 
further and extend the idea to his own feelings towards others.

The Stoics view society and the whole of nature as a connected thing, meant to work together and to attempt to live 
peaceably with one another. As such, knowingly harboring feelings of contempt towards other people in our lives (or that
we don't even know) is against the ideals of a stoic life.

Instead of harboring feelings of frustration, antagonism, or hate towards one another, we should strive to help each other,
to be empathetic and understanding. This does not mean we should allow those busybodies, arrogant, and deceitful take 
advantage of us - but our internal dispositions should be favorable towards everyone, especially these individuals.

These ideas are also central to Christianity, as well as most religions that emphasize peace and forgiveness for one another.

### Takeaway
We encounter difficult people every day. We should not harbor agitation or hatred towards these people - many times they
act on impulse, or because they simply haven't "seen" the goodness of life or within their own selves. 

We can help each other recognize that goodness by showing kindness and patience to all we interact with, and taking a daily
goal of uplifting the people surrounding us is a noble one of high moral value.

Likewise, the negativity given to us from others can only harm us if we allow it. It does not hurt our moral character,
and can not stain the painting of our lives unless we allow it to. Bob Ross notably never made "mistakes" when painting,
but simply "happy little accidents". He turned those ill events into good outcomes, making them beautiful when integrated 
into the final painting. We should strive to do the same.
